    "\n",
    "<a href=#TOC>Back to ToC</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim of This Modelling\n",
    "- Determine the overall relationship of important internal and external features in explaning 2022 rental prices. \n",
    "- In particular, we wish to explore the relationship/trends exhibited from each feature towards the 2022 rental prices, but we don't expect this model to be very accurate in predicting 2022 rental prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model of Choice \n",
    "\n",
    "- The model of choice is <code>ElasticNet()</code>, a penalized regression model. \n",
    "    - Although this model introduces additional constraints (or hyperparameters in technical terms) that need to be manually specified by the user, it is still worth to be done since we would expect highly variable rental prices across sububs, and accounting for the differing characterictics of properties across each suburb with respect to the features that we've obtained. \n",
    "        - Ultimately, not introducing such additional constraints would lead to the model overestimating the importance of a variable too greatly simply based on a few data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Morevoer, deterministic feature engineering techniques is not really recommended because the \"least important\" features are not really important because we want to represent all suburbs in Victoria. This uncertainty can be conveyed through the coefficients from this penalized regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Way to Construct Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a naive way to do it would be to simply fit the full model on the entire data we have and report the coefficients as the feature importances *without evaluating the model*. But from a technical modelling standpoint, there are some problems:\n",
    "1. Although <code>ElasticNet()</code> implicitly performs variable selection, we still don't want our model predictions to be *too biased* in the sense that the predictions are off by large amounts, or in worst case scenario, violates the assumptions from our model, for which I will describe below in technical terms:\n",
    "    - The residuals/prediction errors will increase with respect to the model predictions because then our model then wouldn't be reliable (high model variance). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Methodology to Select \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the overall approach to select a best model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stratify sampling (by suburb) a training data, and let the rest be testing data\n",
    "    - Here, stratify means that a certain proportion of instances corresponding to *each suburb* will be sampled to ensure that the training data is representative enough (containing rental properties in Victoria)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Repeat: \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose best model with best hyperparameters in training data by using 10 fold CV\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot Learning Curve on entire dataset using the model specification and hyperparameters obtained in 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Residual Plot on Training Data \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Do further EDA/Exploratory Data Analysis and/or feature engineering on training data \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analyse learning curve and any patterns in residuals to guide for next feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If satisfied with the model, then stop. Otherwise, go back to step 2. provided any feature engineering methods specified\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are learning curves?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a proposed model obtained from fitting it with a training data (a subset of the full data that we have) how well does it perform when we fit that model on *other* training data and evaluate it on the corresponding test data?\n",
    "    - In particular, as we increase the size of the training data, what we want to check is that:\n",
    "        - Does the model perform *equally* well on the training data and the testing data as a way to examine the generalizablility of the model, and\n",
    "        - Is the performance itself \"reasonably high\"?\n",
    "        \n",
    "- A very important note is that \"performance\" itself is a constraint that has to be quantitatively defined by us. In this case, we will use <code>-1 * Mean Absolute Error</code>, which can be interpreted as <code>-1 * (actual rental price - predicted rental price)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification for the Proposed Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a statistical/inferential approach to evaluate the model fit and complexity, a Machine Learning-based approach (particularly using learning curves) will be used here to, at least, provide some justification to why the model coefficients are reliable as a means of feature importances towards the 2022 rental prices, which will be listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have already standardized the data into the same scale before fitting the model, which makes the model coefficients corresponding to each features comparable to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given the model coefficients as a result of fitting the model with the training data, are they *consistent enough* when we fit that exact same model on different training data and evaluate it on different testing data? This can be answered by plotting learning curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This methdology will inform us whether we're performing excessive feature transformations or not (in step 6 in the \"Proposed Methodology to Select\" section) in a way that causes overfitting; that is, the model *only* increases the performance in the training data but the model does a poor job in explaining other data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the proposed methodology, a total of 4 models were generated to utilize the internal and external features to explain 2022 rental prices, with only one chosen to be the final model.\n"
